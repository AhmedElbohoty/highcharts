  The demo shows how you can visualize AWS server data on a board.<br/>
  In the Dashboard, you can find a few HTML Components that describe an
  instance, some charts (KPI and Spline charts) that visualize data parts, and
  the list of all instances (DataGrid). Click on an instance in the DataGrid to
  update the Dashboard.
