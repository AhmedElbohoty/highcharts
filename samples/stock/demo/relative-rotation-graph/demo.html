        Relative Rotation Graphs visualize the relation between the strength and
        momentum of various assets against a chosen benchmark (i.e. S&P 500 index)
        and themself. The performance is visualized in four quadrants. Leading
        (green) - asset is stronger than the benchmark and it's getting stronger
        (positive momentum), Weakening (yellow) - asset is stronger than the
        benchmark, but it's getting weaker (negative momentum), Lagging (red) -
        asset is weaker than the benchmark and it's getting weaker, Improving
        (blue) - asset is weaker than the benchmark, but it's getting stronger.
