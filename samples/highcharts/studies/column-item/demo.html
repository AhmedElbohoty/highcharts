        POC for a column item chart.

        <pre>
            To do:
            - A marker.symbol option will allow other symbols than circles,
              like squares, rectangles or images. See the ItemSeries for
              implementation code.
            - Padding between items, like series.item.itemPadding.
            - Inverted chart doesn't work well.
            - We could go fancy with the entrance animation and render one dot
              at a time, to simulate a race for the most delegates.
