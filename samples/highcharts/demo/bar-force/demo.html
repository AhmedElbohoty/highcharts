    <p class="highcharts-description">
        This demo shows a horizontally stacked bar chart styled to show how
        various forces contribute to a specific outcome. Each force is depicted
        by a separate bar, stacked together to visually represent their combined
        effect. This visualization aids in understanding the interaction between
        the forces involved, like identifying imbalances and/or each force's
        significance within that specific outcome.<br/>
        <br/>
        The data shown on the chart is a approximation of the effect of forces
        acting on a spacecraft during its entry, descent, and landing on Mars.
        The forces include a combination of the most important factors affecting
        the spacecraft during this phase, such as gravity, drag, lift and more.
        The chart shows how these forces interact and contribute to the overall
        outcome which is to slow the spacecraft down from entry speeds to a
        standstill on the surface.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Note</strong>: The data shown is arbitrary, illustrative, and
        does not reflect actual forces in a Mars EDL (Entry, Descent, Landing)
        sequence. It aims to broadly demonstrate the key dynamics affecting the
        spacecraft during EDL and the relative impact of these forces. The force
        distribution is not to scale and is intended solely to illustrate the
        concept of a stacked bar 'force' chart.
